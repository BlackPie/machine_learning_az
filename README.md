Summary of the "Machine Learning A-Z" online course

I find this course very good and informative. Especially I like parts about regressors, classifiers and neural networks. Of course they couldn't cover a lot of things of such big and complex topic as Deep Learning, but general concepts were explained excellently. I also appreciate it that lecturers didn't talk much about complex math behind algorithms and were more aimed to talk about concepts' intuition. It also allowed them to fit more models and algorithms into the course. When it comes to practice, guys go straight to the point and implement models solving real life problems. Sometimes lecturers spend too much time explaining very basic python things, so that's very useful to have all code related information in this document.
